# Hi there 👋, I'm MonsieurETH

## About me 🧐
Hello, welcome to my secret hideout! I'm a PhD in Computer Science who uses this anonymous account as a haven to separate my personal life from my life as a coder in web3. When I'm not knee-deep in academia, you'll find me here, exploring uncharted territories of coding, contributing to open-source projects, and sharing my passion for technology and programming with a wider audience. Remember, in the realm of code, we are all aliases. So let's get coding!

## Interests 👯
* Compiler Design
* Blockchain 
* Zero-Knowledge Proofs

## How to Reach Me 📫
You can connect with me via email - [monsieurETH@gmail.com](mailto:monsieurETH@gmail.com) - or follow me on Twitter - [@monsieurETH](https://twitter.com/monsieurETH). I'm eager to hear from you!
